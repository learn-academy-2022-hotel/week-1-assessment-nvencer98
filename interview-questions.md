# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is the branches and the files itself , while github is where everything is stored and used, like the cloud. 

Researched answer: Git is a distributed version control system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. a cloud-based Git repository that helps developers store, manage, track and control changes.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: im not sure at this time i will research and get back to the question. 

Researched answer: logical AND &&; logical OR ||; logical NOT !

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: an index is is its positon in a string or array, a value is what it is worth....

Researched answer: a index is its position givin in the list, but it is not its value. you can refer to a index and get the value of the positon on the string.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: strings and arrays can both be lists, both can not be manimuilated the same way, most of the built in commands wont work for a array so you must convert it to  string first to manipulate it them change it back.

Researched answer: The key difference between Array and String is that an Array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a String is a collection of characters.
-An Array is a Linear data structure and group of elements having the same data types. 
-A string is a sequence of characters, or we can say that string is a set of objects that are of char data type. These are organised in a particular manner.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: driver and navigator, the navigator is telling the driver what to type but the driver also bounces ideas back. its to have a second set of eyes on something because it is easy for one person to brush over something. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a practice of two programmers working together on the same task at a single computer. Typically, one of them is a driver and the second one is a navigator. The driver writes the code and the navigator reviews the code and plans the action. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: functions that operate on other funnctions.

2. Jest: javaScript framework used to ensure codding correctness. 

3. Objects: a standalone entity , with properties and a type.

4. Method:  property of an object that contains a function definition

5. Classes: template for creating objects, they encapsulate date with code.
